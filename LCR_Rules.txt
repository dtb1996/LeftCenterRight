LCR Rules

This game requires at least three players with no upper limit.

The goal of the game is to collect every chip.

Every player will begin the game with three chips
The player rolls a die for each chip they have up to a total of three.

The sides of each die contain L, C, R, and dots on the last three sides.
These values determine where the current player's chips will go.
-For each L, one chip is passed to the player on the left.
-For each R, one chip is passed to the player on the right.
-For each C, one chip is placed into the center and taken out of play.
-Dots do not require any action to be taken

If the player runs out of chips they can still have chips passed to them,
but pass the dice to the next player when it is their turn.

The game is over when only one person possesses chips.
