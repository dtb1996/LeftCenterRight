# LeftCenterRight
A recreation of the dice game Left Center Right (LCR) using C++.

Upon starting the program, the user can select from a list of options that allows the rules to be viewed, the game to be started, or to exit the program. The first option runs a function that attempts to read a separate text file. If successful, the contents of the file are displayed, otherwise an error message is displayed on the screen. The start game option runs the main game function and calls other functions to accomplish specific tasks related to the gameplay. It begins by asking how many players will be playing and creates a player object for each prompting for their names. Besides the name of the player, each object also contains data related to the number of chips they possess, initially three, and dice information. After the objects are ready the game begins through various loops and conditional statements. For each round every player is given a chance to roll up to three dice based on the number of chips they have. The numbers of each role are converted to their relative LCR dice values, determining where their chips will go. When only one player has chips, the loop ends, and a winning message is displayed. The game menu is displayed again, allowing the user to select any of the three options mentioned previously.
